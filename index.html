<h1>### Inhenced best notes: Biodiversity</h1> <br>

<h2> Definition</h2>
Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth, including the diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems. It is the foundation of life and ecological balance on the planet.


<h2> Types of Biodiversity</h2> <br>

<p class="topic" > 1. Genetic Diversity   </p>
   - Variability in genes within a single species.   <br>
   - Example: Different rice varieties or breeds of cattle. <br>
 <br>

 <p class="topic" > 2. Species Diversity   </p>
   - Variety of species within a habitat or region.   <br>
   - Example: Coral reefs host thousands of marine species. <br>
 <br>

 <p class="topic" > 3. Ecosystem Diversity   </p>
   - Variety of ecosystems in a given area.   <br>
